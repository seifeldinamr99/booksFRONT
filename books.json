        "overview": "Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan explores the extreme impact of rare and unpredictable events (Black Swans) and human tendency to find simplistic explanations for these events retrospectively. The book argues that unexpected events shape history more than predictable ones, yet we continue to focus on the predictable. Taleb discusses the limitations of statistics and forecasting, particularly in complex systems. The work has influenced thinking in finance, science, and philosophy about uncertainty and risk.",
